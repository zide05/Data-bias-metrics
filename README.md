# Data-bias-metrics
Data bias metrics of Novelty, Repetition, Coverage, Copy length and Sentence fusion score. Calling get_metrics in all_metrics.py to calculate the scores.

The code of Coverage (metrics/fragment.py) is from passage Multi-News: a Large-Scale Multi-Document Summarization Dataset and Abstractive Hierarchical Model.

We change the code of sentence fusion (metrics/ssi_functions.py and metrics/sent_fusion.py) (from passage: Scoring Sentence Singletons and Pairs for Abstractive Summarization.) is partly to get the sentence fusion score.
